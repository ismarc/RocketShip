RocketShip is an LLVM pass designed to generate dot files to present UML activity diagrams based on the bitcode passed to the optimizer.

Use:
In order to use RocketShip from the command line, you need an LLVM bitcode file for input.  This can be generated by passing the -emit-llvm flag during compilation of a file.  Example:
llvm-gcc -v -emit-llvm hello.c -c -o hello.bc

opt -load /path/to/llvm/Release/lib/RocketShip.so -rocketship <filename>.bc > /dev/null

Build Instructions:
Modify the Makefile to have LEVEL point to the top level directory of your LLVM source directory.
run ./configure in the LLVM source directory.
In RocketShip, run make
RocketShip.so will be output to $LEVEL/Release/lib
